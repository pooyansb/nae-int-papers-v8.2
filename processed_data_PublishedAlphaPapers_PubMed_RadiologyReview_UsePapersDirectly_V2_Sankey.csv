McCollough, PhD - **Study Location**: Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA - **Clinical Field**: Cardiac Imaging - **Clinical Task or Condition**: The study focused on evaluating the visual and quantitative estimation of percent diameter luminal stenosis in coronary CT angiography, comparing photon-counting detector (PCD) CT with energy-integrating detector (EID) CT. This is relevant for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease, particularly in the presence of calcified plaques.  - **Key Findings**:   1. Visual estimates of percent stenosis were significantly lower with PCD CT compared to EID CT. Reader 1 reported a median stenosis of 20.6% with PCD CT versus 31.8% with EID CT (P < .001), while Reader 2 reported 6.5% versus 22.9% (P = .002).   2.

The goal was to assess the impact of PCD-CT on the visualization and quantification of different plaque components, which is relevant for improving detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease. - **Key Findings**:   1. Ultra-high-resolution PCD-CT reconstructions with a slice thickness of 0.2 mm and the Bv64 kernel showed significantly lower total plaque volumes and calciﬁed plaque components compared to standard reconstructions (p<0.001), suggesting reduced blooming artifacts.   2. The volume of lipid-rich plaque components was higher in ultra-high-resolution reconstructions (6.7%, interquartiles 5.1–8.4%) compared to standard reconstructions (0.5%, interquartiles 0.0–1.5%), indicating improved visualization of non-calciﬁed components.   3. The study suggests that ultra-high-resolution PCD-CT may enhance the delineation of non-calciﬁed plaque components, which are important for risk prediction in coronary artery disease. - **Post-Processing Techniques**: The study used quantum iterative reconstruction at a strength level of 4. No specific spectral post-processing techniques like VNC or VMI were applied as the ultra-high-resolution mode did not allow for spectral information collection. - **Technical Features**: The study leveraged the ultra-high-resolution capability of PCD-CT, with a spatial resolution of 0.11 mm x 0.11 mm in-plane and 0.16 mm through-plane.

### Structured Summary  **First Author:** Milán Vecsey-Nagy, MD, PhD  **Study Location:** Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC  **Clinical Field:** Cardiac Imaging  **Clinical Task or Condition:** The study focused on the measurement of coronary stenosis and reclassification rates of the Coronary Artery Disease Reporting and Data System (CAD-RADS) using ultrahigh-spatial-resolution (UHR) photon-counting detector CT (PCD-CT) compared to energy-integrating detector CT (EID-CT). The relevance lies in improving the accuracy of stenosis assessment, particularly in calcified plaques, and reducing unnecessary downstream testing.  **Key Findings:** 1. **Stenosis Measurement:** PCD-CT showed lower percent diameter stenosis (PDS) values for calcified plaques (45.1±20.7%) compared to EID-CT (54.6±19.2%, P<0.001). For partially calcified plaques, PDS values were also lower with PCD-CT (44.3±19.6%) versus EID-CT (54.9±20.0%, P<0.001). There was no significant difference for noncalcified plaques. 2. **Reclassification Rates:** Nearly half (49.0%) of patients were reclassified to a lower CAD-RADS category using PCD-CT, indicating its potential to reduce unnecessary further testing. 3. **Accuracy:** PCD-CT showed higher agreement with quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) with a mean difference of 7.3% compared to EID-CT's 17.4%.  **Post-Processing Techniques:** Not specified in detail for individual post-processing techniques like VNC or VMI, but iterative reconstruction strengths were used.  **Technical Features:** The study highlighted the benefits of PCD-CT, including ultrahigh-spatial-resolution (125 µm), reduced electronic noise, and intrinsic spectral sensitivity, which contributed to improved accuracy in stenosis measurements and lower radiation dose compared to EID-CT.  ### CT Scan and Reconstruction Protocol Information  | Protocol Name | Tube Voltage (kVp) | Tube Current (mA) | Rotation Time (s) | Pitch | Slice Thickness (mm) | Algorithm Type | Kernel | Window Settings | Post-Processing Techniques | Technical Features | Radiation Dose | |---------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|----------------------|----------------|--------|-----------------|---------------------------|-------------------|----------------| | EID-CT        | 90-130             | 150-600           | 0.25              | Not Specified | 0.6                  | Iterative (ADMIRE) | Bv40   | Not Specified   | Not Specified              | Standard resolution | 14.9 mSv (Effective dose) | | PCD-CT        | 120                | Not Specified     | 0.25              | Not Specified | 0.2                  | Iterative (QIR)   | Bv40-Bv64 | Not Specified   | Not Specified              | Ultrarigh-Spatial Resolution, reduced noise | 12.3 mSv (Effective dose) |  **Note:** 'Not Specified' indicates details not provided in the paper.",Cardiac,https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCIMAGING.124.017112,"Vecsey-Nagy, M. et al.

### Summary of the PCCT-Focused Paper  - **First Author**: Jilmen Quintiens - **Study Location**: KU Leuven, Belgium - **Clinical Field**: Musculoskeletal (MSK) - **Clinical Task or Condition**: The study focuses on the quantification of bone mineral density (BMD) and the detection of bone remodeling using Photon Counting Computed Tomography (PCCT). It addresses the relevance of PCCT in detecting and characterizing bone density changes and remodeling, particularly in the context of osteoporosis and fracture risk assessment. - **Key Findings**:   1. **Accuracy**: PCCT demonstrated high accuracy in measuring volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) with a Pearson correlation of 0.986 compared to HR-pQCT, showing a bias of 7.46 mgHA/cm³.   2. **Repeatability**: The repeatability at the voxel level showed a bias of 17.66 mgHA/cm³ with a standard error of 96.23 mgHA/cm³. The least detectable remodeling was identified at a threshold of 250 mgHA/cm³, with false remodeling detected in 0.37% of ex vivo voxels and up to 0.97% in vivo.   3. **Clinical Potential**: The study suggests that PCCT can potentially replace or complement HR-pQCT and DXA in clinical settings due to its ability to provide high-resolution, large field-of-view images with lower radiation doses. - **Post-Processing Techniques**: The study utilized image registration and voxel-wise subtraction for assessing repeatability and detecting bone remodeling. A discrete Gaussian filter was applied to noise-match in vivo PCCT images to ex vivo images. - **Technical Features**: Photon counting technology provided improved spatial resolution and contrast-to-noise ratio, allowing for detailed bone microstructure imaging and a reduction in radiation dose by up to 49% compared to conventional CT.  ### CT Scan and Reconstruction Protocol Information  | Protocol Name      | Tube Voltage (kVp) | Tube Current (mA) | Rotation Time (s) | Pitch | Slice Thickness (mm) | Algorithm Type | Kernel | Window Settings | Post-Processing Techniques                      | Technical Features          | Radiation Dose        | |--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|----------------------|----------------|--------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------| | PCCT Ex Vivo       | 120                | 225               | 0.588             | Not Specified | 0.10                 | Iterative      | Qr84   | Not Specified    | Image registration, voxel-wise subtraction      | Improved resolution, lower dose | CTDIvol 11.7 mGy (0.23 mSv) | | PCCT In Vivo       | 120                | 26                | 0.588             | Not Specified | 0.10                 | Iterative      | Qr84   | Not Specified    | Noise-matched with Gaussian filter, thresholding | Improved resolution, lower dose | CTDIvol 1.3 mGy        |  Note: The table summarizes the scan and reconstruction protocols used in the study, highlighting the technical features of photon counting technology that contributed to the study's findings.",MSK,https://doi.org/10.1093/jbmr/zjae163,"Quintiens, J. et al.

Study Location: University of Oulu and Oulu University Hospital, Finland. Clinical Field: Cardiac. Clinical Task or Condition: Evaluation of stable chest pain and suspected coronary artery disease (CAD); assessment of the cost-effectiveness and clinical impact of photon-counting detector CT (Naeotom Alpha) compared to energy-integrating detector CT (Somatom Force) in the Finnish healthcare system. Key Findings: PCD-CT significantly reduced downstream diagnostic costs by 33.8% and 26.9% in two simulated diagnostic pathways using Monte Carlo models of 10,000 virtual patients. Break-even thresholds for recovering the 1.5M investment premium were achieved after 7,880 and 4,950 patients, respectively. Complication rates from invasive coronary angiography (ICA) were nearly halved with PCD-CT (from 81.1 to 43.9 per 10,000 patients), and functional test complications were also reduced. The improvements were attributed to more accurate CAD-RADS classification, minimizing overestimation and unnecessary downstream testing. Post-Processing Techniques: Not specified. Technical Features: Ultrahigh spatial resolution (110 m in-plane, 160 m slice thickness), improved CAD-RADS classification accuracy, reduced blooming artifacts in calcified plaques, spectral capabilities inherent to PCCT that contributed to better clinical decision-making and cost savings.
